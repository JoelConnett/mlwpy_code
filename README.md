# Machine Learning with Python for Everyone

Repo that I will be posting to as I work through the book.

## Setup

This repo uses pipenv to manage dependencies. After cloning the repo run `pipenv update`

## Run

From terminal or the command prompt:

`pipenv run jupyter lab`

This will start Jupyter labs running on your machine. 
To stop jupyter labs press `Ctrl-C` and follow the commands.
